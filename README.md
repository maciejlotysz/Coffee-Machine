# Test

Hello, 

My name is Maciej and I am a new in coding and GitHub. 
I am a self-taught, started learning java in July 2020. 

This repository contains my very first project made during learning java with JetBrains Academy on hyperskill.org in Sep 2020.

This is not a final version. The code is ugly as hell and needs a lot of improvments and needs to be refactored. 
A class is overloaded, doing too much. I need to make a functional decomposition, claan the code, make a code more readable and easy for changes.

I will do it soon..
