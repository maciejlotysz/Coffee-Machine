Coffe Machine

Hi there, 

My name is Maciej and I am a new in coding and GitHub. 
I am a self-taught, started learning java in July 2020. 

This repository contains my very first project made during learning java with JetBrains Academy on hyperskill.org in Sep 2020.

The code is ugly as hell and needs a lot of improvments and needs to be refactored. 
A class is overloaded, doing too much and everytjong is static.

Refactored a bit with help of my friend (Senior Software Engineer).

The hardest step is the first one. I did my first step. Ugly as hell but but still counts :D
